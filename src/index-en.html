                            Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (LUTS) affects around 9% of domestic cats, and an average
                            of 1.6 to 20% of these animals are diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). These
                            diseases can occur due to increased body weight or obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, excessive
                            stress, an unbalanced diet and less water intake, the latter being the main reason for the
                            onset of these diseases. As these animals usually need fresh, running water, the adoption of
                            a drinking fountain is a better option. This work therefore proposes the development of an
                            intelligent integrated system with an automatic drinking fountain and an informative mobile
                            application, with the aim of reducing the chances of domestic animals showing symptoms of
                            urinary tract diseases, especially felines, which are the subject of this research.
                            The methodology was therefore divided into 7 stages: (1) a bibliographic survey on Feline
                            Lower Urinary Tract Diseases (FLUTS) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD); (2) research into the
                            technological hardware and software resources for developing the work; (3) definitions of
                            the structure and models of adaptable drinking fountains; (4) definitions of the application
                            and programming tools; (5) technical development of the project; (6) data collection, field
                            research and interviews; and (7) testing and error correction. The expected results were the
                            control of the water temperature, as well as the provision of information about the pet's
                            water habits to the guardians, the connection between the sensors, the prototyping board and
                            the drinking fountain used in the work, the full functioning of the application and its
                            integration with the physical prototype, the dissemination of information to the population
                            about the importance of the project and, finally, the reduction of risks of urinary diseases
                            in felines.

                            The aim of this work is to achieve fundamental objectives for the development of the
                            prototype and the research, which can be subdivided into two main axes: the general
                            objective and the specific objectives. The general objective focuses on creating an
                            integrated system for monitoring and controlling water consumption in cats, with a view to
                            preventing urinary tract diseases. The specific objectives cover more detailed and technical
                            aspects of the development. These include the implementation of an electronic circuit
                            capable of capturing precise data on the water behavior of pets and the integration of this
                            data with a mobile application that allows the guardian to monitor it in real time.
                            Finally, it is hoped that there will be full interaction between the general and specific
                            objectives pursued in the project, so that the development of the water monitoring system
                            for cats can not only fulfill its practical function of preventing disease, but also
                            demonstrate how technological solutions can be applied efficiently and affordably in animal
                            care.

                            Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD) and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affect a
                            significant proportion of domestic cats, largely due to low water intake, sedentary
                            lifestyles and inadequate diet. As cats tend to drink little water, especially if it is not
                            fresh or on the move, the search for effective solutions to encourage water consumption is
                            essential.

                            This work is justified by the creation of an integrated smart drinking fountain and mobile
                            app system, which aims to monitor water intake and prevent urinary diseases. The proposal
                            contributes not only to the health of felines, but also to disseminating the importance of
                            preventive care, using technology that is accessible and applicable to the daily lives of
                            guardians.

                            The methodology adopted for the project followed the engineering approach and was divided
                            into seven stages: a literature survey on urinary tract diseases in cats; research into
                            technological hardware and software resources; definitions of the structure and models of
                            adaptable drinking fountains; definitions of the application and programming tools;
                            technical development of the project; data collection, field research and interviews; and
                            testing and error correction.
                            The assembly was carried out in such a way as to guarantee the proper functioning of all the
                            electronic components, allowing the sensors implemented in the physical prototype to capture
                            precise data on the pet's water consumption and transmit it to the visualization
                            environment.

                            The system is therefore expected to function fully, accurately controlling water intake and
                            temperature, as well as providing detailed data on pets' water habits to their owners. The
                            integration between sensors, the prototyping board and the smart drinking fountain is
                            essential to ensure the effective collection and transmission of this information.
                            The project also aims to raise public awareness of the importance of water monitoring for
                            cats, using the app as an effective channel for disseminating this information. Ultimately,
                            it is hoped to reduce the risk of urinary diseases in cats, promoting a better quality of
                            life for the animals and greater peace of mind for their owners.

                            A prevenção ou tratamento de doenças do trato urinário em felinos requer uma
                            alimentação balanceada, além da diminuição de aspectos estressantes para o animal e
                            a modificação do ambiente em que este habita. O estímulo ao consumo de água pode ser
                            considerado o elemento mais importante do manejo alimentar, visto que a maior
                            ingestão hídrica dificulta o acúmulo de agentes nocivos na urina. Como os gatos
                            domésticos tendem a ser exigentes quanto à maneira que a água é disponibilizada a
                            eles, uma das alternativas para contornar essas condições seria a adoção de um
                            bebedouro ou fonte de água fresca, o que proporciona um consumo maior de água quando
                            comparado a um recipiente. Esse comportamento é possível de observar uma vez que
                            nota-se os gatos domésticos frequentemente consumindo água através de torneiras ou
                            fontes, o que acaba sendo mais atrativo ao animal. Diante disso, o mercado atual
                            oferta diversos modelos de fontes de água específicas para estes felinos, entretanto
                            muitos destes produtos não têm o objetivo de estimular os gatos a beber água visando
                            a diminuição de doenças urinárias.

                            O projeto consiste na criação de um bebedouro automático para gatos visando
                            estimular sua ingestão de água e reduzir doenças do trato urinário. Inicialmente,
                            foi realizado um levantamento bibliográfico sobre doenças urinárias em felinos e
                            seus comportamentos hídricos, seguido pela pesquisa de recursos tecnológicos para o
                            desenvolvimento do protótipo. O projeto foi estruturado com base em um bebedouro
                            adaptado com filtros e bomba de água, e uma coleira equipada com etiquetas RFID. A
                            aplicação e desenvolvimento do projeto envolveram a integração desses componentes,
                            incluindo um microcontrolador ESP32 programado para registrar o consumo de água.
                            Testes foram realizados para verificar o funcionamento do hardware e software,
